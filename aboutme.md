### Background
The foundational years of my career can be summarized by a drive to understand how we view and manage the natural world. This ambition drove me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies at Boise State University. As an undergraduate, I was able to amass experience in education curricula development, local and state politics, and land management across the Western US. The pinnacle of my undergraduate career was being named a Top Ten Scholar of the 2022 graduating class. 

I joined the [Freshwater Ecology and Conservation Lab](https://www.oldenfish.com/) at the University of Washington in the fall of 2022. Please see my [Research](https://cvaage.github.io/#) page for more information about my current work. Beyond research, I hold a variety of roles within the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. I founded and currently serve as the President of the [UW AFS Student Subunit](https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-and-career-opportunities/student-organizations/american-fisheries-society/). A passion for outreach and education continues as I serve as the Co-Lead of the Lesson Planning Committee for the volunteer group [Students Explore Aquatic Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/alumni-community/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/) (SEAS). Finally, I get to foster valuable community building and more through my role as Social Chair for the [Fisheries Interdisciplinary Network of Students](https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/fins-fisheries-interdisciplinary-network-of-students/) (FINS).
