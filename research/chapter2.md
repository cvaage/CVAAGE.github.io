title: Effects of High Density Competitors to Early Life History Steelhead
subtitle: Predation? Resource competition? Let's find out!
---
### Summary
My second chapter is centered around investigating direct effects of the invasive rusty crayfish on a population of threatened steelhead using stable isotope analysis and other laboratory-based methods. In the summer of 2023, I led a 5-week field season in the South Fork of the John Day River which is home to a dwindling population of roughly 600 summer-run steelhead. State and tribal biologists currently lack the capacity to further investigate how the relatively recent invasion could be affecting the species of high concern. By reconstructing the aquatic food web and leveraging the unique isotopic signature held by Pacific salmon, I can understand critically important ecosystem dynamics like competition for resources and predation of steelhead eggs by crayfish. With this work, I hope to contribute to a knowledge gap regarding invasive crayfish species in Western waterways and open systems in particular.
