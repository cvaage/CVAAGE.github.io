### Past
The foundational years of my career can be summarized by a drive to understand how we view and manage the natural world. This ambition drove me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies at Boise State University. As an undergraduate, I was able to amass experience in education curricula development, local and state politics, and land management across the Western US. The pinnacle of my undergraduate career was being named a Top Ten Scholar of the 2022 graduating class.

### Future

"But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you."
