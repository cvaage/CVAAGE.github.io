title: Science as a Community-Builder
---
As a student in the field of aquatic ecology, I am constantly seeking out the most powerful ways in which I can positively impact natural resource conservation. For me, this role falls on the intersection of research and education. Being both a public servant and scientist, I want to improve our approach to managing waterways across the West by reducing barriers to stakeholder engagement. What I aim to accomplish during my masterâ€™s degree is to (1) gain a practical understanding of how to lead basic and applied research, (2) establish strong educational community structures that can persist for students following me, and (3) impart my unique perspectives from my background to encourage fruitful discourse. These ambitions will enable me to make an indelible mark on aquatic resources and the communities that rely on them.
